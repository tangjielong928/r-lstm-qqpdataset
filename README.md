# r-lstm-qqpdataset
This is an implementation of *Neural Paraphrase Generation with Stacked Residual LSTM Networks* in [Quora dataset](https://data.quora.com/First-Quora-Dataset-ReleaseQuestion-Pairs). We divided different training and test sets and evaluated the model with Metrics (BLEU and METERO) in them. And we compare this model in Quora with our designed model. The generated (paraphrasing) text result is saved in ./model/generated.
